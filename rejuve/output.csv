By using advanced AI to combine data from the long-lived Methuselah Flies and other model organisms with data from the Rejuve Network and other human populations,  we can shorten the drug discovery pipeline and rapidly develop novel therapeutics to help people live longer. Exclusive rights to data from long-lived Methuselah Flies (fruit flies) bred for longevity. Multiple interventions and combinations of treatments can be tested across their entire lifespan. Crowdsourced Human Data from a Tokenomically-Incentivized Network collected by partner companyRejuve Network. World-leading community of scientists using neural-symbolic machine learning, reasoning, and transfer learning to analyze animal model data and make hypotheses about human longevity. Unique highly advanced AI toolkit developed for over a decade for exactly this research; dynamically leveraged and updated by neural, symbolic and evolutionary algorithms. Rejuve Biotech is developing an innovative drug discovery platform and translational medicine service that combines anin-house model organism population with a unique analytical platform.The platform combines state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial general intelligence methods with acontinuously updated biomedical knowledge graph integrating human and model organism databases.  The Rejuve Biotech model of choice is thelong-lived Methuselah Fly, a type of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), selectively bred over hundreds of generations tolive up to 5 times longer than wild-type flies.  We can use the sequencing technology to identify specific pathways that contribute to the Methuselah Flies’ longevity and then use AI and machine learning tools tointegrate that information with human health and omics data, allowing us to identify common genetic pathways that can be studied in real-time using the flies’ relatively short lifespan, shortening the drug discovery pipeline, and helping todevelop therapeutics that will target aging and aging-related disease. Memex Nutraceutical  Restores Alzheimer-model flies to mobility Memex Nutraceutical Shown Effective for Humans with Mild/Moderate Alzheimer’s The Rejuve Biotech team's earlier AI analyses correlating Methuselah fly data with human genomics and medication databases have already demonstrated proof of concept, with theresulting treatment preserving cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients. ​ A supplement targeting AMPK, among other pathways, was developed in 2013 for Genescient Corp. using the results of Dr. Goertzel’s AI analysis of Methuselah Fly data and then tested in patients suffering from mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease over the course of 15 months. Patients taking the supplement were able to maintain cognitive function above the expected disease trajectory, Janet Adams Chief Operation Officer Linkedin Dr. Ben Goertzel Chief AI Scientist Linkedin Kennedy Matsagas Schaal Chief Executive Officer Linkedin Michael Duncan Chief Science Officer Linkedin Dr. Axel Schumacher Chief Biotechnology Officer Linkedin Lewis Farrell Senior Marketing Consultant Linkedin Hedra Yusuf Chief Technology Officer Linkedin Abdulrahman S.
